## Improved Overlays

Overlays are an easy way to add elements like buttons to BPMN elements. As of this release you can specify if you want your overlays to scale and when they should be visible:

```javascript
overlays.add(task, {
  html: '<div>I am an overlay!</div>',
  position: {
    top: 0,
    right: 0
  },
  show: {
    minZoom: 0.8, // overlay will not be visible at zoom <0.8
    maxZoom: 1.2 // overlay will not be visible at zoom >1.2
  },
  scale: {
    min: 0.8, // overlay will not scale below 0.8
    max: 1.2 // overlay will not scale above 1.2
  }
});
```

Note that `show` and `scale` are optional and that overlays will now always be visible by default. You can set the defaults when creating a bpmn-js instance:

```javascript
new BpmnJS({
  overlays: {
    defaults: {
      show: {
        minZoom: 0.7,
        maxZoom: 5
      },
      scale: {
        min: 1
      }
    }
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Other Improvements

We've also included a few more improvements in [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js). Zooming [is now deterministic](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/commit/11637d53b6ec2b0be0d2ae8e864de85fd6f5bb1d) meaning you can always zoom back to the initial zoom. Furthermore, SVG groups added to the canvas [can now be ordered](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/commit/f734d0af85c859307c9a5c64848d32687fae5ebf).

## What's happening in the bpmn.io sphere?

We've updated the [example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/tree/master/example) for using diagram-js. You can use it as a starting point for building your own diagram-js-based application.

  </a>
</div>

Furthermore, we've recently started working on a new version of our [DMN 1.1 viewing and modeling tool](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js) focussed on performance. Stay tuned for a release towards the end of the year.
