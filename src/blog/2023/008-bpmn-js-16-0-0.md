<p class="introduction">
  We are happy to announce [bpmn-js@16](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and [dmn-js@15](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js) releases! Sentence-cased labels are now used consistently across our tools. If you use custom translations for these labels learn how to update them to work with bpmn-js@16.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

We have updated bpmn-js and dmn-js to use sentence case for all labels to improve readability.

  <p class="caption">

Along with bpmn-js we have also updated all translations available as part of [bpmn-js-i18n](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n). If you use bpmn-js-i18n in your project, update to the latest version. If you have created custom translations and want to use bpmn-js@16, you need to update them [accordingly](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n/commit/bfa0696804e753ee97af727ec74c6dad4209cf10).
