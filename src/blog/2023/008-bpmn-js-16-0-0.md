## Vertical Pools

Thanks to a [community contribution](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/pull/2024) bpmn-js can now render vertical pools and lanes.

Want to model vertical pools and lanes, too? This is your chance to contribute to [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js)!


## Updated Translations

A more subtle change is the update of our translations. We now use sentence case for all labels and titles to improve readability.

<div class="figure full-size">
  <a href="https://demo.bpmn.io/s/start">
    <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2023/008-translations.png" alt="Labels are now sentence case">
  </a>

  <p class="caption">

  </p>
</div>

Along with bpmn-js we have also updated all translations available as part of [bpmn-js-i18n](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n). If you are using bpmn-js-i18n in your project, make sure to update to the latest version. If you have created custom translations and want to use bpmn-js v16, you need to update them [accordingly](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-i18n/commit/bfa0696804e753ee97af727ec74c6dad4209cf10).
