<p class="introduction">
  We are excited to announce [dmn-js@12](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js). This release focuses on providing better DMN 1.3 support. We replaced Camunda Platform 7 specific parts with their DMN counterparts while improving the configurability of the toolkit.

## FEEL Data Types

DMN FEEL specifies a set of primitive types on which you can build the logic of your decision diagram. We added each of the FEEL types to both the decision table and the literal expression views with this release. You can now specify time, date and time, and duration per default. In your application based on dmn-js, you can define your types via configuration.

## Breaking Changes

Because release focuses on providing a pure DMN 1.3 experience, we have dropped the `camunda` namespace dependency. This change makes the library ready to model decisions for any DMN engine with [dmn-scala](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/dmn-scala) among them.

To develop an application for Camunda Platform 7, consider using a new project based on dmn-js: [camunda-dmn-js](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-dmn-js). This new library provides modeler distributions tailored to Camunda Platform 7 and Camunda Platform 8.
