<p class="introduction">
  We are happy to announce the latest releases of our modeling toolkit which ship with modern JavaScript syntax, namely ES2018.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

The releases introduce modern language constructs to the codebase, i.e. async/await, ES6-style classes, as well as rest/spread operator. We believe this will allow reduce the burden on contributors who won't need to limit to ES5 syntax anymore.

## Migration

You don't have to do anything to prepare for the new versions unless you require support for ancient browsers such as Internet Explorer 11. Also, if you already transpile your code using tools such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), no additional steps are required.

Otherwise, you need to setup a transpilation step in your bundler pipeline. A common way to do this is to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), for example via [a Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-babel) in your [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) configuration:

```javascript
// rollup.config.js
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import babel from '@rollup/plugin-babel';

export default {
  input: 'src/main.js',
  output: {
    file: 'bundle.js',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [resolve(), babel({ babelHelpers: 'bundled' })]
};
```

Cf. [rollup guide](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#babel).

If your bundler of choice is [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), check out [the bundling example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/pull/184).
