<p class="introduction">
  We are happy to announce the latest releases of our modeling toolkits. These new major versions incorporate a single change: We ship them with modern JavaScript syntax, namely ES2018, and browser features.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

The releases introduce modern language constructs to the codebase, i.e. async/await, ES6-style classes, as well as rest/spread operator. The target runtime of the libraries is ES2018 from now on, and the bundled output will use ES2018 syntax and features. Furthermore, we stop shipping [shims/polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shim) to support long dead browsers (bye bye Internet Explorer!).

For library users, this results in smaller bundles. Performance improves where modern language features are no longer polyfilled. For us and our contributors this means a productivity boost: We may now use modern language features without transpilation and debug the real thing in case of an error, not a source-mapped representation.

## Migration

You don't have to do anything to prepare for the new versions unless you require support for dead browsers such as Internet Explorer. Also, if you already transpile your code using tools such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), no additional steps are required.

Otherwise, you need to setup a transpilation step in your bundler pipeline. A common way to do this is to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), for example via [a Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-babel) in your [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) configuration:

```javascript
// rollup.config.js
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import babel from '@rollup/plugin-babel';

export default {
  input: 'src/main.js',
  output: {
    file: 'bundle.js',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [resolve(), babel({ babelHelpers: 'bundled' })]
};
```

Checkout the full [rollup guide on using Babel](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#babel). If your bundler of choice is [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), check out [the bundling example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/pull/184).
