<p class="introduction">
  We are excited to announce [bpmn-js@9](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). The release adds the ability to model and drill down into collapsed sub-processes. That simplifies working with collapsed sub-processes and should give you a convenient way to hide complexity in your BPMN diagrams.

## Collapsed Sub-Process Modeling, Improved

Expanding and collapsing sub-processes in place is not enough. To work with them conveniently in more complex BPMN diagrams, you want to inspect and change their contents without touching the parent element. This bpmn-js release allows you to do precisely that: Drill into a collapsed sub-process to examine and change it. Navigate back up with simple breadcrumb navigation.

## Changes Under the Hood

bpmn-js is meant to be embedded into your application. You need to be aware of a few changes when upgrading from an earlier version of bpmn-js. Most notably, make sure to include the new style sheet `bpmn-js.css`, either from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/bpmn-js/dist/assets/bpmn-js.css) or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpmn-js).

The `canvas` API in diagram-js also became a major overhaul and now supports multiple root elements at once. The [deep linking example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/main/deep-linking) shows you how you can use the new root element APIs.

Check out the full [changelog of bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#900) and [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#800) for all breaking changes that may require your action during the upgrade.
