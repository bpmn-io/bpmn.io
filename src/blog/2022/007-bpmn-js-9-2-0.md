<p class="introduction">
  We are excited to announce the [bpmn-js@9.2](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) release. The new version of our BPMN toolkit improves the modeling experience with better selection visuals and improved drag/resize handles. It also adds a context pad for multiple elements and improves our BPMN support.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

The most noteworthy change in [bpmn-js@9.2](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#920) is an improved selection UI:

<div class="figure full-size">
  <a href="https://demo.bpmn.io/s/start">
    <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2022/007-selection.gif" alt="New selection UI shipped with bpmn-js@9.2">
  </a>

  <p class="caption">
    Selection, more obvious.
  </p>
</div>

As part of the rework, we removed the (visual) hover state and added a dedicated multi-select
box. Both aim to better match user expectations and align with existing drawing tools.

Try out the reworked selection UI on [demo.bpmn.io](https://demo.bpmn.io/s/start).


## Improved Drag Handles

Along with the selection rework, we've overhauled drag/resize handles.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2022/007-drag-handles.gif" alt="Improved resize/drag handles shipped with bpmn-js@9.2">

  <p class="caption">
    Clearer resize/drag handles on the canvas.
  </p>
</div>


## Multi-Element Context-Pad

Along with multi-selection, the toolkit now offers a way to register context pad entries for multiple elements:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2022/007-deletion.gif" alt="Element deletion built on top of our new multi-element context pad">

  <p class="caption">
    Delete multiple elements with a single click.
  </p>
</div>

We ship a multi-element delete action per default and allow you to [provide your own](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/pull/1525).


## Annotate Flows

Starting with this release you can annotate sequence and message flows:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2022/007-annotations.png" alt="Message flow and sequence flow annotations">

  <p class="caption">
    Attach text annotations to sequence and message flows.
  </p>
</div>
