<p class="introduction">
  We're happy to announce the latest release of form-js. It submits data in a predictable way and introduces default values for form fields.
</p>

# Submit Data in a Predictable Way

Previously, it wasn't entirely clear what data would be submitted when clicking _Submit_. The result could have been data without a form field or no data even though there was a form field. As of this release, data will be submitted for every form field even if no data was imported. No additional data will be submitted. If the form has 10 form fields, the submitted data will have ten entries. Form fields that cannot have an empty value, such as a radio group, will be submitted as null if no value was selected.

# Set Default Values for Form Fields

Form fields can now have a default value that will be used if no data was imported for a form field. Unless it is changed, it will also be submitted.
