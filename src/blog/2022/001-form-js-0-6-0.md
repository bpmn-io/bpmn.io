<p class="introduction">
  We're happy to announce the latest release of [form-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/form-js), our form builder and renderer. This release introduces default values for form fields. Additionally, it makes form submission more predictable; exactly what you modeled is now being submitted, no more, no less.

## Form Field Default Values

This release adds the ability to specify default values for form fields. The toolkit uses default values during initial form rendering if no data for a form field exists. Unless changed or removed, it will also submit the value as the user completes the form.

## A More Predictable Submit Behavior

Previously, it wasn't entirely clear what the form would pass along during submission: Data without a corresponding form field would be submitted if passed during import, or no data would be submitted even though there was a form field.

With this release, we fundamentally reworked the form submission behavior: The toolkit now submits a value for every _enabled_ form field, even if you did not provide an initial value. It clearly indicates missing or removed data with a `null` submission. Finally, the toolkit omits data for disabled form fields and data not backed by a form field.

The improved behavior should make form submission more predictable and _safe_: As a user, you can rest assured that exactly what you modeled gets submitted. Modeled but missing data is appropriately represented in the submitted output, too.
