<p class="introduction">
  We're happy to announce the latest release of [form-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/form-js), our form builder and renderer. This release introduces custom properties for form fields.
</p>

With this form-js release, you can specify custom properties for form fields. You define these properties through the properties panel, and the form editor will export them with the form definition file.

## Using Custom Properties

You can use custom properties to extend forms in several ways; the classic example is to enrich the form schema before rendering the form.

The following shows how to pre-populate the options of a select field dynamically based on a custom property called `externalData`:

```javascript
const { components } = schema;

for (let i = 0; i < components.length; i++) {

  const field = components[i];
  const {
    properties,
    id,
    type
  } = field;

  if (type === "select" && properties && properties.externalData) {

    // use custom property "externalData" to get external API endpoint
    const endpoint = properties.externalData;
    const res = await preloadData(endpoint, "GET");

    // map API response to field values
    field.values = res.map(option => ({
      value: option.id,
      label: option.name
    }))

  }

}

// render form with enriched schema
form.importSchema(schema);
```

Let's say we want to populate the options of a "Customer" select field with active customers. Using the snippet above, this can be achieved by having an `externalData` property, which value is the API endpoint to be used to retrieve this data.

```javascript
 const schema = {
     ...
    components: [
      {
        label: "Customer",
        type: "select",
        id: "Field_1",
        key: "costumer",
        values: [],
        properties: {
          externalData: "https://mycompany/active-customers"
        }
      }
    ]
    ...
};
```
