<p class="introduction">
  We are excited to announce the [bpmn-js@9.1](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) release: The release allows you to select container elements by clicking on them anywhere. That significantly improves the interaction with participants and expanded sub-processes.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

You can now click anywhere into a container to select it:

<div class="figure full-size">
  <a href="https://demo.bpmn.io/s/application-processing">
    <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2022/006-selection.gif" alt="Improved participant/sub-process selection shipped with bpmn-js@9.1">
  </a>

  <p class="caption">
    Enjoy the new container selection in larger process and collaboration diagrams.
