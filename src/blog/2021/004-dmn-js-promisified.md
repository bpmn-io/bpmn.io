<p class="introduction">
One of our top priorities is to ensure the best possible developer experience consistently across our libraries. Following this priority, we are happy to announce the latest release of our [DMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js). This release ships with `Promise` support for our async import and export APIs. Using this release, users can `await` API results and therefore benefit from async features available in modern, ES6-style JavaScript codebases.

<!-- continue -->

This release brings `Promise` support to our async toolkit APIs, allowing you to `await` the import or export results in a state-of-the-art manner:

```javascript
const modeler = new DmnJS();

try {
  await modeler.importXML(dmnDiagramXML);
} catch (err) {
  // handle import error
}
```

Callbacks style invocations are still supported but will be dropped in a future major release. We advise you to migrate to `Promise`-based API usage. Refer to [the moving to Promises documentation](http://bpmn.io/l/moving-to-promises) to learn about how to migrate using detailed examples. If you are still targeting [Internet Explorer or Opera Mini](https://caniuse.com/#feat=promises), ensure you polyfill the global `Promise` object.


## Promisified Import and Export APIs

You can now `await` these `dmn-js` APIs:

* [DmnJS#importXML](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-io-callbacks-to-promises#importXML-dmn-js)
* [DmnJS#open](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-io-callbacks-to-promises#open-dmn-js)
* [DmnJS#saveXML](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-io-callbacks-to-promises#saveXML-dmn-js)
* [DmnJS#saveSVG](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-io-callbacks-to-promises#saveSVG-dmn-js)


Here's a small example of how to open a DMN diagram in the _new way_.

```javascript
const modeler = new DmnJS();

try {
  const {
    warnings
  } = await modeler.importXML(dmnDiagramXML);

  console.log('Imported DMN 1.3 diagram', warnings);
} catch (err) {

  const {
    warnings
  } = err;

  console.log('Failed to import DMN 1.3 diagram', err, warnings);
}
```

Here is a small example of how to export a diagrams SVG in the _new way_.

```javascript
try {
  const {
    svg
  } = await modeler.saveSVG();

  console.log('Exported DMN 1.3 diagram in SVG format', svg);
} catch (err) {

  console.error(err);
}
```

For more examples, check by our [our example repository for dmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js-examples). It is already updated to feature the promisified APIs in action!
