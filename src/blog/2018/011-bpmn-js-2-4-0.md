<p class="introduction">
  We're proud to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). The release greatly enhances connection layouting around boundary events and adds the ability to model self-referencing loops.
</p>

The layout of connections in [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) is quite straightforward and therefore predictable. However, this simple layout causes issues when connecting a boundary event to either the activity it is attached to or in some cases any other flow element. As a result, the connection was hidden behind other flow elements. The same was true for connections that connect an element with itself.

  <p class="caption">
    Previously, laid out connections could become inaccessable when connecting boundary events.
  </p>
</div>

With this release we ship several layouting enhancements that handle these cases appropriately.


## Boundary to Activity Loops

Boundary to host loops, a recurring modeling pattern, are now supported properly:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/010-boundary-events-1.gif">
  <p class="caption">
    Layout connections between boundary event and its host.
  </p>
</div>

Connections between boundary events and other flow elements will be layed out accordingly, too:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/010-boundary-events-2.gif">
  <p class="caption">
    Layout connections between boundary event and the activity it's attached to.
  </p>
</div>


## Self-Loops

Self-loops, often times used used in conjunction with conditional flows, are now supported, too:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/010-loops.gif">
  <p class="caption">
    Layout loops.
  </p>
</div>


## Under the Hood: More Layouting Options

For those of you using [ManhattanLayout](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/main/lib/layout/ManhattanLayout.js) in their own application the good news is, the API hasn't changed but you now have more options to configure it. In addition to `h` for horizontal and `v` for vertical you can now use `t`, `r`, `b` and `l` for top, right, bottom and left. Since these options are more specific then horizontal and vertical they will be followed when laying out a connection.

As an example, you may expect the following layout by forcing the two rectangles to be connected from left to right:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/010-custom-layout.png">
  <p class="caption">
    You now have more control over how you connections are laid out.
  </p>
</div>

For more examples feel free to have a look at the [unit tests](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/main/test/spec/layout/ManhattanLayoutSpec.js) for `ManhattanLayout`.


## Other Improvements

This release also ships with a few additional improvements and fixes:

* `FEAT`: create label on appropriate free position ([#825](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/825))
* `FIX`: repair label position not being adapted on host move
* `FIX`: revert to `Arial` as the default rendering font ([#819](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/819))
* `FIX`: keep event definitions when switching from interrupting to non-interrupting boundary event ([#799](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/799))
* `FIX`: correct updating of multiple data stores ([`300e7010`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/commit/300e7010c4e1862394d147988dc4c4bcc09b07bc))
