<p class="introduction">
  With this release, we're officially discontinuing bower bundles for our [BPMN modeler and toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) as well as the bpmn-js seed project. Alternatives are already in place along with reworked and simplified examples.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

Fetching versions of our BPMN toolkit via [Bower](https://bower.io) has long been the recommended way of accessing pre-packaged distributions of our library. Bower, however is nowadays operating in [maintainance mode](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/). It has its disadvantages during build and distribution, too, such as the lack of a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) to directly serve project assets.
Those are just two good reasons we are discontinuing our [bower bundles](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bower-bpmn-js) today.

From this release on, pre-packaged versions of bpmn-js are published directly
with our releases to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpmn-js).
Include these artifacts directly, without prior download via the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bpmn-js@0.27.0/dist/bpmn-viewer.development.js"></script>

<script>
  var viewer = new BpmnJS({ container: 'body' });

  viewer.importXML(bpmnXML, function(err) {

    if (err) {
      console.log('error rendering', err);
    } else {
      console.log('we are good!');
    }
  });
</script>
```

Check out the new [pre-packaged example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/pre-packaged) to learn more.


## Migrating from Bower

If you're currently relying on our bower distribution, include files directly from the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/bpmn-js@0.27.0/).
Alternatively, download the latest toolkit directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/releases) on GitHub or install them via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).


Either way, the `dist` folder provides pre-packaged variants of bpmn-js under the following names:

```html
dist/bpmn-modeler.development.js
dist/bpmn-modeler.production.min.js
dist/bpmn-navigated-viewer.development.js
dist/bpmn-navigated-viewer.production.min.js
dist/bpmn-viewer.development.js
dist/bpmn-viewer.production.min.js
```

As in the bower packaging `dist/assets` contains the `diagram-js.css` as well
as the bpmn font distribution used by the bpmn-js modeler.


## Better Examples

We've taken this move as an opportunity to rework and simplify some of [our examples](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples):

* A new [starter example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/starter) provides the [modeler](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/master/starter/modeler.html) and [viewer](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/master/starter/viewer.html) as simple HTML pages.
  This example effectively replaces our [bpmn-js-seed project](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-seed).
* Many examples, including [colors](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/colors) or the [url-viewer](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/url-viewer) can now directly be opened and inspected without prior setup, too.
* The [custom-bundle example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/custom-bundle) (previously `custom-bower-bundle`) now showcases both the extension and bundling of a custom bpmn-js variant.
* We've removed the `simple-bower` and `simple-commonjs` examples.
  The more succinct [pre-packaged](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/pre-packaged) and [bundling](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/bundling) examples take their place (and will hopefully cause less confusion).

We hope that these adjustments make it easier to try out and dive into bpmn-js.


## Other Changes

Two additional changes made it into this release:

* `FEAT`: be able to intercept the `contextmenu` event on shapes
* `FIX`: correctly serialize colors set via modeling API


## Wrapping up

Hopefully, our latest changes make it easier for people to integrate and play around with out toolkit. We look forward for many great single HTML page bpmn-js powered applications!
