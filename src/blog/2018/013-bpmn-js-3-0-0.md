<p class="introduction">
  Ensuring the best possible user experience when modeling BPMN diagrams is our top priority. Today's release v3.0.0 release of our [BPMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) marks another step into this direction. It includes the latest version of [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) which ships with better accessibility and more keyboard customization options.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

In previous versions of [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) both context pad and popup menu by default were scaled like any other element in the diagram. As a result they weren't usable if you zoomed in or out to far.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/013-context-pad-resize-previous.png" alt="Inaccessible context pad due to high zoom level">
  <p class="caption">
    Before: Context pad inaccessible at high zoom level.
  </p>
</div>

As of this release both context pad and popup menu will not scale in order to be accessible at all zoom levels.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/013-context-pad-resize-current.png" alt="Bpmn-js context pad scaled to fit screen">
  <p class="caption">
    After: Context pad accessible at all zoom levels.
  </p>
</div>

This behavior is can be configured. It's possible to set the minimum and the maximum scale levels as well as to restore previous settings.


## Keyboard Enhancements

Previously, it wasn't possible to override existing keyboard shortcuts such as the default ones for undo and redo. This release ships with a refactored keyboard that allows creating keyboard shortcuts with priorities, similar to how adding listeners to the [EventBus](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/core/EventBus.js) works.

It also ships with new default keyboard shortcuts for moving elements on the canvas. Whenever there is a selection of elements they can be moved using the arrow keys. (Use `Shift` for faster movement). If there is no selection the canvas will be moved instead. If there is a selection and you want to move the canvas use `Ctrl` or `Cmd`.

  <p class="caption">
    New feature: Move selected elements using the keyboard.
  </p>
</div>

For more details on how to create shortcuts, have a look at the default [keyboard bindings](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/features/keyboard/KeyboardBindings.js) implementation.


## Group Names

For now, it's not possible to model groups (a box around a group of objects within the same category). It is, however, possible to show them. As of this release, category values are shown in the diagram:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2018/013-group-name.png" alt="BPMN group labeled as 'my group'">
  <p class="caption">
    New feature: Category values are now shown in the diagram.
  </p>
</div>


## Global Connect Changes

In order to align the [global connect](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/features/global-connect/GlobalConnect.js) feature more closely with [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) we've refactored it to use the [rules](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/features/rules/Rules.js) feature when determining if a connection can be created. Therefore, we removed both the [`GlobalConnect#registerProvider`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/commit/1efb277536fa7ec8be574746326c15cb1bfa507a#diff-a5849a5aebbb0383f299c810af4ab13bL108) method and [`BpmnGlobalConnect`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/026fe11ea716b4ec9974468fcca65d179824cbfb/lib/features/global-connect/BpmnGlobalConnect.js) which is now obsolete.

If you were using the `GlobalConnect#registerProvider` method you can add a rule for `connection.start` in order to achieve the same behavior. For an example, have a look at [BpmnRules](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/ba42e9edde02ea9d310c08ff5e48484b19b470cb/lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js#L52) which allows removing `BpmnGlobalConnect` entirely.

## Other Improvements

This release ships with a few additional improvements and fixes:

* `FEAT`: adjust tooltip titles for `IntermediateCatchEvents` ([350a5ab](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/commit/350a5ab75ed675991599faff9615e4bbe184d491))
* `FIX`: disallow to attach a `BoundaryEvent` to a `ReceiveTask` following an `EventBasedGateway`. As an effect, the `BoundaryEvent` is removed after connecting elements  ([#784](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/issues/784), [#874](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/874))
* `FIX`: fix date in license ([#882](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/pull/882))
* `FEAT`: add ability to move selection with keyboard arrows ([#376](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/376))
* `FIX`: bind to actions in `EditorActions` and register keyboard shortcuts only for actions implemented via features ([#887](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/pull/887))
