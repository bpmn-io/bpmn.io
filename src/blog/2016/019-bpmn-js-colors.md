<p class="introduction">
  We are proud to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeler / toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js).
  It brings support for colors in BPMN diagrams and adresses a number of small drawing and modeling issues.

## Color Your Processes

Colors help you communicate certain aspects on your process models more effectively. With the latest bpmn-js release you can now use them for whatever you'd like to; to communicate ongoing work on the diagram (Ã¡ka _needs discussion_) or to mark certain diagram elements as _special_ (whatever that means in your organization).

### Built-in Color Support

Colors work in both modeler and viewer and get read from / persisted to the BPMN 2.0 XML using a vendor extension.
To set colors in the modeler, do that programatically:

```javascript
var bpmnModeler = ...;
var modeling = bpmnModeler.get('modeling');

var elementsToColor = [ element1, element2 ];

modeling.setColor(elementsToColor, {
  stroke: 'green',
  fill: 'yellow'
});
```

Starting with `bpmn-js@8.7` the toolkit persists colors according to the [BPMN in color specification](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-in-color).

### Color Pickers?

We deliberately decided to not include any color picker. This is because the usage of colors (and the variety of colors to offer) is highly domain specific. Adding a color picker will probably not be complicated for you, too. How it could look like in your application? Check the following screenshot taken from the soon to be released [Camunda Modeler](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler):
