<p class="introduction">
  We are proud to announce the latest release of [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). It adds the ability to translate the BPMN modeler into different languages (aka i18n) and allows you to model collapsed pools. On top of that it addresses a number of usability issues. Under the hood we performed some major improvements that should make it easier to work with bpmn-js as a library.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

A collapsed pool is one of the elements we could import/render for a longer time.
This release adds the ability to actually model it.
To create a collapsed pool, replace an expanded one with it via the context pad:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2016/006-collapsed-pool.gif">
</div>

You can change it back to an expanded pool, again via the element's context pad.

_BPMN notice:_ We assume a collapsed pool to be a pool/participant without an attached process reference. It is not defined as part of the BPMN 2.0 spec, so your mileage using this BPMN concept may vary.


## Translation Support (i18n)

We received a [community contribution](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/pull/475) that adds internationalization to bpmn-js (and [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) underneath).

I18N is implemented via a function that receives a template as well as an object of replacements. As part of diagram-js we provide a [dead simple default implementation](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/i18n/translate/translate.js).

In order to provide a custom translation you have to provide a custom translate function to the library:

```javascript
function customTranslate(template, replacements) {

  if (template === 'Create {type}' && replacements.type === 'bpmn:StartEvent') {
    // we know German!
    return "Erzeuge ein Start-Ereignis";
  }

  // fallback to default language otherwise

  ...
};
```

As part of your custom translate function you can use the translation technology of your choice.

To create a German BPMN modeler, provide the `customTranslate` function to bpmn-js during bootstrapping:

```javascript
var translateGermanModule = {
  translate: [ 'value', customTranslate ]
};

var modeler = new BpmnModeler({
  addditionalModules: [ translateGermanModule ]
});
```

Have a look at [our test suite](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/master/test/spec/i18n/custom-translate/custom-translate.js) for a translation example that knows Spanish and provides a fallback to the default language.


## bpmn-js as a Library Improvements (TM)

This release brings significant improvements for [using bpmn-js as a library](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/237).

Previously you had to import a BPMN diagram before accessing diagram services such as the [`CommandStack`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/command/CommandStack.js). Starting with this release, our BPMN modelers/viewers are instances of [`Diagram`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/lib/Diagram.js) and share diagram services across imports. This also means that you can retrieve services before the initial import, too:

```javascript
var modeler = new BpmnViewer({ ... });

// configure the modeler
var commandStack = modeler.get('commandStack');

$('#undo-button').click(function() {
  commandStack.undo();
});

// perform the diagram import
modeler.importXML(...);
```

_Hint:_ Try this with older bpmn-js versions ;-).


The bpmn-js instance (viewer/modeler) now exposes a set of import life-cycle events. These events allow you to hook into the diagram importing process, i.e., to easily react to import errors and warnings:

```javascript
modeler.on('import.done', function(err, warnings) {

  if (err || warnings.length) {
    window.alert('IMPORT PROBLEMS!', err || JSON.stringify(warnings));
  }
});

modeler.importXML(someXML);
```

Note that we made the callback in `Viewer#importXML` optional, too.


## What is next?

Based on the feedback we received in the last month we decided to dedicate the next bpmn-js milestone to huge diagrams. As [part of the milestone](https://waffle.io/bpmn-io/tasks?milestone=B16%20-%20Huge%20Diagrams) we will work on features such as a global connect tool, copy and paste and other improvements.

Do you have valuable feedback on the topic? Tell us about it [via our forums](https://forum.bpmn.io).

Make sure to [follow us on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@bpmn_io) if you would like to keep track on what is happening in the bpmn-io sphere.
