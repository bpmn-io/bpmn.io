<p class="introduction">
  We are proud to announce the latest version of [cmmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/cmmn-js). This release is all about modeling convenience. It introduces snapping and auto-expanding, both well established features known from bpmn-js. Besides that the new version adresses plenty of bugs.

[Try out snapping and the auto expand feature](http://demo.bpmn.io/cmmn/s/claims-file) and [give us feedback](https://forum.bpmn.io/c/users)!

## Snapping

Once you know the snapping feature from [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) you don't want to model diagrams without it in cmmn-js. If you create, move or append CMMN elements, this features ensures that they are visually aligned with sibling elements. This is a vital contribution to a neatly arranged and readable CMMN diagram.

## Auto Expand

We are committed to give you a convenient modeling experience. Approved features from bpmn-js might be a good idea for cmmn-js as well. That's why we added the auto expand feature. It ensures that borders of case plan models, stages and plan fragments get expanded when the space is getting narrow.
