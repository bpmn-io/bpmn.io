<p class="introduction">
  We are proud to announce the latest version of [dmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js). In this release we greatly improved usability by offering assistance when entering simple values for the most common data types. We also now allow setting a minimum width for columns, which improves the handling of tables with a lot of inputs and outputs. Furthermore it is now possible to add descriptions to individual cells.

## Simple Editing

We added support for simple editing for the data types boolean, string, date and number. By default, if you want to edit a cell that has one of these data types, a dialog is opened that offers assistance entering the correct values. If you want to have more complex expressions, you can switch to an advanced view.

## Minimum Width

Tables with a lot of in- and outputs sometimes cannot fit into the provided space comfortably. In this release, we support setting a minimum column width. When the number of in- and outputs raises, we ensure that the single column always has a minimum width.

To set the minimum column width in your dmn-js instance, just set the minColWidth property when initializing the Modeler.

```javascript
var viewer = new DmnViewer({
  container: 'body',
  minColWidth: 200
});
```

## Cell Descriptions

Cells that contain complex expressions can sometimes be hard to understand at a first glance. To help the business user better understand the purpose of a cell, we allow setting a description to the cell. If a cell contains a complex expression, we display this description instead of the actual cell content, unless you switch to an advanced view, were you can also edit the expression.

## What else?

Besides fixing several bugs, we also added the possibility to copy rules and allow to set the expression language for a cell. You are now able to use multiple expression languages within one table.

## What is next?

This dmn-js release improves usability when editing a decision table. But DMN offers even more.
Our next steps will focus on the modeling of Decision Requirements Diagrams (DRD).
