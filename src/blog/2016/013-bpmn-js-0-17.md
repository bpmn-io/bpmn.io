<p class="introduction">
  We are proud to announce the latest version of [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). In this release we're introducing the possibility to morph between collapsed and expanded sub processes. We also focused our efforts into better usability, thus label handling and direct editing have been reworked. Furthermore it is now easier to create activities, events and gateways of a specific type from the palette.

## Expanded vs. Collapsed Sub Processes

We added support for morphing expanded to collapsed sub processes and vice versa. The good thing: all elements inside a sub process are retained when the sub process is collapsed. The original size of the sub process plus all containing elements are visible again if you expand the sub process later.

## Label Handling And Direct Editing

Further improvements were achieved regarding label handling and direct editing. Now the size of a label depends on text length. An important benefit is the more compact size. This leads to less overlapping ocurrences between labels and other elements.

## Create Elements Of Specific Types

A common use case is to create activities, events and gateways of a specific type. Up to now this was merely possible by creating a blank element, opening the replace menu and selecting the type. Now we get you one click closer to this goal. Press and hold `ctrl` or `cmd` when dragging an element from the palette and the replace menu will open right away.

## What else?

Besides fixing several bugs, we improved the *space tool's* visuals. Now you're able to see a preview of the resizing result on container elements.

## What is next?

This bpmn-js release improves the usability when modeling and labeling diagrams. We are not done here, though.
Improvements for text annotations are in our pipeline to enable better documentation experiences.
