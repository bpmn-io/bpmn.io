<p class="introduction">
  We're proud to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). It ships with several improvements regarding connections layout as well as important modeling fixes and support for multiple BPMN diagrams within one file.
</p>

The connections layout in [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) has already been greatly improved in [bpmn-js v2.4.0 release](https://bpmn.io/blog/posts/2018-bpmn-js-2-4-0.html). However, it still caused issues when a boundary event was connected to a flow element straight below or when reconnecting elements. It is not the case anymore.

  </p>
</div>

Numerous layout improvements introduced in this release appropriately handle these cases.

## Improved Reconnecting Layout

Moving a connection start or end is now handled adequately.

  <p class="caption">
    Reconnecting elements looks better than ever.
  </p>
</div>

As a side-effect, the new layout behavior is applied also after element removal. Element's connections will be joined and adequately laid out.

  </p>
</div>

## Collapsed Pool Enhancement

In the current release, the pool shrinks automatically after the collapse. You don't need to do it manually anymore.

  </p>
</div>

## Multiple BPMN Diagrams Support

A not commonly known feature of BPMN 2.0 is that you can include multiple diagrams within one XML file. This feature allows you to have a different perspective on the same semantics or even show only parts of the collaboration in a detailed view.

With this release, we add support for such a case. When [importing an XML](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/v3.4.0/lib/Viewer.js#L179), pass the ID of a diagram that you want to open.

```javascript
import Viewer from 'bpmn-js';

var viewer = new Viewer();

viewer.importXML(xml, diagramId, function(error, warnings) {
  if (!error) {
    console.log('Imported XML and opened diagram with id: %s', diagramId);
  }
});
```

Also, with the new `Viewer#open` method, it's now possible to switch the currently displayed diagram to another one already contained within the imported XML file. You can pass the ID or a diagram object derived from definitions. Same applies to the Navigated Viewer and the Modeler.

```javascript
viewer.open(anotherDiagramId, function(error, warnings) {
  if (!error) {
    console.log('Opened diagram with id: %s', anotherDiagramId);
  }
});

// or

var definitions = viewer.getDefinitions();

viewer.open(definitions.diagrams[1], function(error, warnings) {
  if (!error) {
    console.log('Opened the second diagram in the file.');
  }
});
```

## Other Improvements

This release also ships with a few additional improvements and fixes:

* `FIX`: properly render colored connection markers ([#981](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/issues/981))
* `CHORE`: bump to [`diagram-js@3.3.0`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#330)
