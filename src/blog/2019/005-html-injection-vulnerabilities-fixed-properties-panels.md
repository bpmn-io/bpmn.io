<p class="introduction">

Missing input saniation leads to several HTML injection / <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)">cross-site scripting</a> vulnerabilities in our BPMN, CMMN and DMN properties panel libraries.

These issues affect all users that embed the properties panels along with the diagram editors. They allow an attacher to execute arbitary JavaScript in the context of the embedding website if properties for specially configured diagram elements are being viewed.


## Patched Versions

The following library releases fix the issues:

* `bpmn-js-properties-panel@0.31.0`
* `cmmn-js-properties-panel@0.8.0`
* `dmn-js-properties-panel@0.3.0`
