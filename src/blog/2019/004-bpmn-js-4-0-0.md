<p class="introduction">
  Today, we are happy to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). It ships several improvements that make modeling smoother and more predictable, with connection previews and grid snapping among them, as well as adds long-awaited support for modeling BPMN Group elements.

One of the key factors that influence the modeling experience is the tool's predictability. The feature that aims to improve this is the connection preview. With this release, you will see a laid out connection of the correct type before you even click to confirm the action.

## Grid Snapping Everywhere

Another improvement that greatly enhances the modeling experience is grid snapping. It is now much easier to create clean, readable diagrams, as all elements and connections are aligned to a grid.

## Attachable and Detachable Events

From now on, it is much easier to create a boundary event. Simply drag an existing intermediate event and drop it on activity's bounds to attach it as a boundary event.

You can also detach a boundary event and thus turn it into an intermediate event.

## Group Support

Last but not least, in the current release, we also prepared a feature that allows to easily group elements. So far, you could use [extensions like colors](https://bpmn.io/blog/posts/2016-colors-bpmn-js.html) to mark related flow nodes on the diagram. From now on, you can do this with the group, which is a valid BPMN 2.0 element.
