<p class="introduction">
  We're proud to announce the latest releases of our [BPMN](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and [DMN](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js) toolkits. New in DMN: The DRD editor shows connection previews as you drag and is now based on top of our current diagram editing foundation. New in all diagram editors: An improved (re-)connect experience that swaps the connection direction as needed.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

The updated diagram editors now allow you to connect elements regardless of what the direction of the resulting connection will be. If the elements can be connected, youâ€™re able to connect them. The same also applies to reconnecting connections to other elements.

In conjunction with previews of the resulting connection this allows you to learn the implemented standards in a graceful manner, without running into a brick wall.

    In BPMN, you can connect a sequence flow <em>to</em> but not <em>from</em> an end event.

## DRD Connection Previews

The decision requirements diagram (DRD) editor shipped with [dmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js) incorporates the latest improvements in our diagram editing foundation: Connection previews. Re-connect an element and get an immediate feedback what the resulting connection will look like.
