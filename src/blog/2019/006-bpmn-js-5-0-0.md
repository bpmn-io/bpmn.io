<p class="introduction">
  We're proud to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). It ships an important navigation update that makes modeling and exploring huge diagrams easier. A reworked, two-step copy and paste allows you to duplicate elements in your beloved diagrams in a more predictable way.

With the latest release, we improved the navigation in huge diagrams by making canvas movement the default drag interaction inside sub-processes and participants/lanes. Start dragging inside a container and cruise through the canvas, rather than moving the element.

Would you like to move a container element? Grab it by its border or header.

## Two-Step Copy & Paste

We completely reworked copy and paste inside the BPMN editor. While pasting elements, you will have the choice of where to place them. This behavior leads to fewer surprises and more control of your copied elements. On top, you will enjoy using our <a href="https://bpmn.io/blog/posts/2019-bpmn-js-4-0-0.html" target="_blank">recently released grid snapping feature</a> when pasting into the diagram.

Under the hood, the rework resulted in a couple of breaking changes:

* Several copy and paste events got removed in favor of new ones
* Modeling rules for pasting are replaced with rules for creating multiple elements
* Create may now create multiple elements
