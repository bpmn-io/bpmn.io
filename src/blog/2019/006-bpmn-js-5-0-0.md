<p class="introduction">
  We're proud to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeling toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). It ships several improvements that make modeling and navigation in huge diagrams easier. It offers a reworked, more predictable way of copy and pasting in your beloved diagrams.

With the latest release, it is possible to navigate in the context of huge diagrams way smoother. We reworked the move operations inside sub processes and participants to accomplish a better navigation experience. Start dragging inside such a container element and cruise through the canvas.

Do you wonder how to move a participant or sub process? Easily grab it on its borders or, additionally, on its header.

## Two-Step Copy & Paste

We created an entirely reworked way of copy and pasting inside our modeling tools. While pasting elements, you will have the choice of where to place them. This behavior leads to fewer surprises and more control of your copied elements. On top, you will enjoy using our <a href="https://bpmn.io/blog/posts/2019-bpmn-js-4-0-0.html" target="_blank">recently released grid snapping feature</a> when pasting into the diagram.

Under the hood, reworking the copy and paste functionality resulted in a couple of breaking changes for our modeling toolkit libraries. Several copy and paste events got removed in favor of new ones, which you can attach to from now on. Additionally, certain `BpmnRules` are removed or replaced in order of the reworked implementation. Have a look at the detailed changelog of [`bpmn-js`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500) to ensure no breaking change is missing during your upgrade.
