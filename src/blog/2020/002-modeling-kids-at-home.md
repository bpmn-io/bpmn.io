<p class="introduction">
  We're proud to announce the latest update of our [BPMN modeler and rendering toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). The release ships major simplifications to our BPMN modeling experience and a fresh symbol set. Combined, they make BPMN modeling more engaging and family, kids-at-home friendly. Define your next workflow with all local stakeholders today. You will recognize the difference!

A shared understanding and visibility of procedures are essential for frictionless collaboration. When it comes to workflows, we have always embraced tools such as BPMN to provide that understanding and clarity. Draw a BPMN diagram. It will tell more than a thousand words.

That holds for home-workflows that power our daily family operations, too. However, here the target group is different. We want to be more visual. We must be more visible. And we must tame the complexity of BPMN&mdash;reduce it to the core&mdash;if we would like to include all stakeholders.

That is what we are delivering today: A brand new BPMN modeling experience baked into our [BPMN toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js), that is simplified, refreshing, and engaging for the whole family.

## Benefits Over Classic BPMN

Compared to our old, classic look, the updated iconography looks bold and refreshing. Beyond that, it offers some immediate benefits, too.

### Motivating

A process is nothing if we do not follow it. The new, positive look does not only motivate to _draw_ but also to _do_ what has been drawn.

### Designed For Safe Operation

A [livelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#Livelock) is a special kind of deadlock. It describes the situation in which your workflow is stuck in a way that makes it impossible to continue. With careful color-coding we ensure you catch this as well as other issues while you model your workflow and not while you are exercising it.

Double-checking with a broken diagram makes it clear: With color coding in place, it becomes much harder to overlook potential fork / join related issues.

## It is Standard BPMN, After All

We still save all diagrams as standard BPMN 2.0 documents. That means you can open your workflows in tools that offer the classic BPMN look and feel. Or you can exchange your processes with your local BPMN professional to help you polish and roll them out.

Finally, you could dive into _process automation_ yourself and get machines to help you orchestrate some of your agreed-upon family routines. Pick any BPMN compliant process engine for that. We recommend [Camunda](https://camunda.com/).
