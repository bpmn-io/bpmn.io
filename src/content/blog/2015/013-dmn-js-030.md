<p class="introduction">
  We are happy to announce the release of the latest version of [our DMN modeler](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js). Dmn-js allows you to view and model decisions with the DMN standard directly on the web. With this latest version dmn-js is officially maintained by the team of bpmn.io.

## What's new

We now support DMN 1.1 in favor of DMN 1.0. If you used the toolkit before, you will feel at home right away as this change is mostly invisible on the UI. However, it allows the files created by dmn-js to be exectued by decision engines using DMN 1.1, such as [Camunda](https://camunda.org/).

The new version supports setting a hit policy to specify what is part of the result of the decision table evaluation.

It is now also possible to hide technical details. This feature is especially useful for business users that are not interested in the variable names and types of the underlying execution and want to concentrate on the logic of the table itself.

We also improved on the DMN viewer: If you open an overlay to see more details about a field, components are now visibly marked as read-only when the table is in viewer (non-editable) mode.

Internet Explorer is now supported up from IE 9.

## What's next

For the next release we plan to improve the usability of the table editor. Features on our roadmap include auto-completion for allowed values as well as the possibility to edit the script language for input and output cells.
